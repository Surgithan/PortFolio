                My name is C. Thanga Surgithan, and I am currently pursuing training in the MERN Stack
                (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) at Pumo Technovation, Chennai, Tamil Nadu. I am
                passionate about full-stack web development and enjoy building responsive and dynamic web
                applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the frontend, I work with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and React.js to create
                user-friendly and interactive interfaces. For the backend, I use Node.js with Express.js to
                develop RESTful APIs and handle server-side logic. I manage data using MongoDB, and
                integrate it with my applications using Mongoose.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am continuously improving my skills by working on real-time projects and exploring modern
                web development practices. My goal is to become a skilled full-stack developer and
                contribute to building scalable and efficient web applications.
